# Vanier Real-Time Schedule API
Made using rust, does not work anymore due to the master schedule being removed.

# Disclaimer
I re-coded the backend in TypeScript and developed new web scraping workflows to dump courses, rather than fetching real-time data.

Demo of the new website can be found here: https://vanier-schedule-maker-2.vercel.app/
